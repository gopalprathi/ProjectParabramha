#Website project to save food wastage and waste management

Parbramha Website Plan

Introduction: 
We know in India poverty hunger rate is at very high than rest of the world. Some poor people cannot even afford one time food and they have to have face hunger. This problem targeted the poor children’s and due to this problem they face health issues.  
On other hand at some places like parties, events, marriage receptions the food wastage happen and remaining food get wasted and thrown away. Sometime the quantity of leftover food is as high as hundreds of people can eat the meals from leftover. But due to no proper food wastage management food wastage happens.
Our motto is to avoid such wastage and to get food distributed among poor peoples or at anathalay.  
Site will be act as mediator between party holder/Events places and the NGOs/Food distributor. It will provide a form to fill the form with fields like leftover food items and place and time for food allotment. The form will be published immediately and notifications get sent to NGOs of food availability and ad get published on site. Whoever NGO claims leftover food it can pick the food at allotted time.
Site will also accept donations for NGOs who provide food for poor people.
We can also extends site to avoid other wastes like electronics accessories, cloths, toys, furniture or anything that can be donated to needy.
